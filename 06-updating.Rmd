## The R Programing Language




 ```{block type='rmdlightbulb', echo=TRUE}
**Updating `R`**

The best way to update is to go to the webpage and download/install as if you did not have R on your computer.  

You do NOT need to uninstall old versions of R on your computer.

Follow the directions in the previous chapter, [here](#installR).
```

## The R Studio IDE

 
 ```{block type='rmdlightbulb', echo=TRUE}
 
**Updating `R Studio`**

1. Open the **R Studio** program on your computer
2. Click on the word **Help** on the menu at the top of the screen
3. Click on the option to **Check for Updates**
4. If there are updates avalible, folllow the directions.
```

## All Your R Packages
