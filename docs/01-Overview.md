Before we get busy downloading and installing the actual software, here is the big picture.

-------------------------------

## R vs. R Studio

First time users often confuse by all the different uses of the letter "R". 

| $R$ | $R Studio$ |
| ---|-----------|
| Engine | Dashboard |
| Install and Ignore | Interact with Constantly |

> More precisely, $R$ is a *programming language* that runs computations while $R Studio$ is an *integrated development environment (IDE)* that provides an interface by adding many convenient features and tools. So the way of having access to a speedometer, rearview mirrors, and a navigation system makes driving much easier, using $RStudioâ€™s$ interface makes using $R$ much easier as well.  - [Chester Ismay and Albert Y. Kim](https://ismayc.github.io/moderndive/index.html)

> $R Markdown$ documents are fully reproducible. Use a productive **notebook** interface to weave together narrative text and code to produce elegantly formatted output. Use multiple languages including $R$, $Python$, and $SQL$ [@R-rmarkdown].

> `knitr` is an engine for dynamic report generation with $R$. It is a package in the statistical programming language $R$ that enables integration of **R code** into $LaTeX$, $LyX$, $HTML$, $Markdown$, $AsciiDoc$, and $text$s documents [@R-knitr].
