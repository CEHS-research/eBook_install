# Install Packages

We describe packages and their management

-----------

## What are packages

> **R packages** are collections of functions and data sets developed by the community. They increase the power of **R** by improving existing base **R** functionalities, or by adding new ones.

More information may be found here:  https://www.datacamp.com/community/tutorials/r-packages-guide

## Installing packages (via the user interface)

> You only need to INSTALL packages ONCE per computer.


In **R Stuido**:

1. Click on the **Packages** tab the panel with the most tabs
2. Click on the word **Instsall** just under and to the left of the tab
2. In the **Packages** box, type in the name of the packages you would like to download.  You can do several at once, just seperate them with multiple spaces or a comma.

*Note: Leave the installation library path as the default.  Also, make sure the box for 'Installing dependencies' is checked.*

You can *copy-and-paste* the following list into the box (labeled 3) to load the packages that we use most commonly all at once. 

> tidyverse, furniture, pander, stargazer, texreg, xtable, RColorBrewer, gghighlight, ggthemes, ggfortify, ggalt, ggExtra, GGally, ggeffects, corrplot, gpairs, gridextra, likert, vcd, scales, cowplot, yarrr, psych, polycor, corpcor, sjlabelled, sjPlot, sjmisc, sjstats, Hmisc, labelled, afex, emmeans, corpcor, multicomp, multcompView, car, effects, predictmean, nlme, lme4, lmerTest, HLMdiag, geepack, gee, gee4, optimx, MuMIn, lavaan, OpenMx, sem, semPlot, randomForest, randomForestSRC, ggRandomForests, party, partykit, mgcv, glmnet, survival, caret, bookdown, blogdown, tidytex, xaringan, REDCapR, redcapAPI, devtools, testthat, roxygen2

When you click the **Install** buttom, a smaller window may asks if you would like to re-start $R$ prior to installing, choose "no" and manually close and open the $R Studio$ program once all packages have been downloaded, unpacked, and checked.  This may take a few minutes, especially if you have selected multiple packages.  


> See Chapter 6 for more information on how to install packages another way (via syntax code), as well as website links for each package.
