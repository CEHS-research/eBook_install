It serves as reference material for graduate courses (EDUC/PSY 6600, EDUC/PSY 7610, PSY 7650, ect.), as well as college wide workshops and individualized consultation from the Statistical Consulting Studio and the Data Science and Discover Unit. Background FAQs What is R ? \\(R\\) is a language and environment for statistical computing and graphics. (R Core Team 2018) \\(R\\) provides a wide variety of statistical (linear and nonlinear modelling, classical statistical tests, time-series analysis, classification, clustering, …) and graphical techniques, and is highly extensible. The \\(S\\) language is often the vehicle of choice for research in statistical methodology, and \\(R\\) provides an Open Source route to participation in that activity. One of \\(R\\)’s strengths is the ease with which well-designed publication-quality plots can be produced, including mathematical symbols and formulae where needed. Great care has been taken over the defaults for the minor design choices in graphics, but the user retains full control. What is R Markdown ? According to R Studio: “R Markdown is a format that enables easy authoring of reproducible web reports from R. It combines the core syntax of Markdown (an easy-to-write plain text format for web content) with embedded \\(R\\) code chunks that are run so their output can be included in the final document”. What is Dynamic Reporting? From Penn State Statistics: The traditional way to write a report: Run your analysis in software, like SPSS or R and manually save our output i.e. saving the ANOVA table or using pdf() to save the graphs Type your your description and interpretation in a text editor like Word either drag/drop tables and figures, or worse copy-paste and retype all the numbers A report written in this way can be problematic. For instance, imagine your Mentor/collaborator/journal reviewer telling you that they want to use a sub-sample instead of the entire sample. Or to include a nother variable. You would have to redo all of your work!! Therefore, in this way dynamic also means reproducible, in the sense that people who get the file from you can reproduce the entire work in the report. How does R Markdown work out to be a .pdf or .html file? \\(R Markdown\\) is a file with the file extension .Rmd, the knitr package will then transform the file into a Markdown file with the extension .md. Then \\(R Studio\\) can (Xie 2015): Use \\(LaTeX\\) to transform the file into a .pdf Load another package called \\(markdown\\) to transform the file into .html Use Pandoc to even convert to file to a Word document (ugly) The professionals ar \\(R Studio\\) show it better at their website. Is this a popular method for creating reports? Check out Rpubs. This website shares lots of documents written in the way we will introduce below. "],

So the way of having access to a speedometer, rearview mirrors, and a navigation system makes driving much easier, using \\(RStudio’s\\) interface makes using \\(R\\) much easier as well. - Chester Ismay and Albert Y. Kim For a more in-depth discussion on the difference between \\(R\\) and \\(R Studio\\) IDE, watch this DataCamp video (2m52s). 1.2 R Markdown vs. R Notebook 1.3 The Magic of Knit’ing \\(R Markdown\\) documents are fully reproducible. Use a productive notebook interface to weave together narrative text and code to produce elegantly formatted output. Use multiple languages including \\(R\\), \\(Python\\), and \\(SQL\\) (Allaire et al. 2018). knitr is an engine for dynamic report generation with \\(R\\). It is a package in the statistical programming language \\(R\\) that enables integration of R code into \\(LaTeX\\), \\(LyX\\), \\(HTML\\), \\(Markdown\\), \\(AsciiDoc\\), and \\(text\\)s documents (Xie 2018).

They increase the power of R by improving existing base R functionalities, or by adding new ones. More information may be found here: https://www.datacamp.com/community/tutorials/r-packages-guide 5.2 Installing packages (via the user interface) You only need to INSTALL packages ONCE per computer. In R Stuido: Click on the Packages tab the panel with the most tabs Click on the word Instsall just under and to the left of the tab In the Packages box, type in the name of the packages you would like to download. You can do several at once, just seperate them with multiple spaces or a comma. Note: Leave the installation library path as the default. Also, make sure the box for ‘Installing dependencies’ is checked. You can copy-and-paste the following list into the box (labeled 3) to load the packages that we use most commonly all at once. tidyverse, furniture, pander, stargazer, texreg, xtable, RColorBrewer, gghighlight, ggthemes, ggfortify, ggalt, ggExtra, GGally, ggeffects, corrplot, gpairs, gridextra, likert, vcd, scales, cowplot, yarrr, psych, polycor, corpcor, sjlabelled, sjPlot, sjmisc, sjstats, Hmisc, labelled, afex, emmeans, corpcor, multicomp, multcompView, car, effects, predictmean, nlme, lme4, lmerTest, HLMdiag, geepack, gee, gee4, optimx, MuMIn, lavaan, OpenMx, sem, semPlot, randomForest, randomForestSRC, ggRandomForests, party, partykit, mgcv, glmnet, survival, caret, bookdown, blogdown, tidytex, xaringan, REDCapR, redcapAPI, devtools, testthat, roxygen2 When you click the Install buttom, a smaller window may asks if you would like to re-start \\(R\\) prior to installing, choose “no” and manually close and open the \\(R Studio\\) program once all packages have been downloaded, unpacked, and checked. This may take a few minutes, especially if you have selected multiple packages. See Chapter 6 for more information on how to install packages another way (via syntax code), as well as website links for each package. 5.3 Updating packages "],

This folder location must be the Working Directory for the R Studio session. If you opened your .Rmd notebook file by double-clicking on its name, then this should be the case. 6.2 Setting the working directory To ensure that R Studio knows where to find the files, you can manually set the Working Directory through the menu: Click Session Select Set Working Directory by hovering your mouse over it Click on To Source File Location You can double check that you were successful by Click on the Files tab in the many-tab panel Click on the button with the gear that says More Click Go To Working Directory At this point you should see all the files that reside in the folder location where the open .Rmd files is also saved. 6.3 Press the Knit button "],
