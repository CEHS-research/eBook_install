FYI", " Encyclopedia of Quantitative Methods in R, vol. 0: Setting up Your Computer Sarah Schwartz &amp; Tyson Barrett Last updated: 2018-08-15 Welcome Preface This encyclopedia of eBooks is being developed by the Office of Research Services to serves the faculty and graduate students in the College of Education and Human Services at Utah State University. The three main purposes are to: Provide reference material for graduate quantitative methods courses (EDUC/PSY 6600, EDUC/PSY 7610, PSY 7650, ect.) Support college wide workshops given by the Statistical Consulting Studio and Data Science and Discover Unit Facilitate individual consultations with the authors pertaining to research. This massive undertaking started during the summer of 2018 and is far from complete. The outline of seven volumes is given below despite any one being complete. Feedback is welcome via either author’s email. Volumne Link Content Vol. 0 Setting up Your Computer: Installing R, R Studio, and Packages Vol. 1 Data Management: Importing, Sub-Setting, Creating Variables, and Saving Vol. 2 Exploratory Data Analysis: Summary Statistics and Descriptive Visualizations Vol. 3 Testing Mean Differences: t-tests, ANOVA, RM ANOVA, and post hoc tests Vol. 4 Multiple Linear Regression: Correlation, Model Fit, Generalize, and Plot Vol. 5 Multilevel Models (RM Regression): ICCs, MLM/HLM, and GEEs Vol. 6 Structural Equation Modeling: EFA, CFA, Path Analysis, and SEM Vol. 7 Additional Topics: Room for Future Expansio Authors Dr. Sarah Schwartz Dr. Tyson Barrett Sarah.Schwartz@usu.edu Tyson.Battett@usu.edu Statistical Consulting Studio Data Science and Discover Unit Why R ? ADD SECTION: R vs. SPSS, SAS, Stata, ect… FYI The entire encyclopedia is written in \\(R Markdown\\), using \\(R Studio\\) as the text editor and the bookdown package to turn a collection of markdown documents into a coherent whole. The book’s source code is hosted on GitHub, at https://github.com/cehs-research/eBook_install. If you notice typos or other issues, feel free to open an issue on GitHub or send me a pull request.

So the way of having access to a speedometer, rearview mirrors, and a navigation system makes driving much easier, using \\(RStudio’s\\) interface makes using \\(R\\) much easier as well. - Chester Ismay and Albert Y. Kim For a more in-depth discussion on the difference between \\(R\\) and \\(R Studio\\) IDE, watch this DataCamp video (2m52s). 1.2 R Markdown vs. R Notebook ADD SECTION: need a diagram built 1.3 The Magic of Knit’ing \\(R Markdown\\) is a file with the file extension .Rmd, the knitr package will then transform the file into a Markdown file with the extension .md. Then \\(R Studio\\) can (Xie 2015): Use \\(LaTeX\\) to transform the file into a .pdf Load another package called \\(markdown\\) to transform the file into .html Use Pandoc to even convert to file to a Word document (ugly) The professionals ar \\(R Studio\\) show it better at their website. \\(R Markdown\\) documents are fully reproducible. Use a productive notebook interface to weave together narrative text and code to produce elegantly formatted output. Use multiple languages including \\(R\\), \\(Python\\), and \\(SQL\\) (Allaire et al. 2018). knitr is an engine for dynamic report generation with \\(R\\). It is a package in the statistical programming language \\(R\\) that enables integration of R code into \\(LaTeX\\), \\(LyX\\), \\(HTML\\), \\(Markdown\\), \\(AsciiDoc\\), and \\(text\\)s documents (Xie 2018). Helpful Website: Quick R: Basic Statistics 1.4 Additional FAQs What is R ? \\(R\\) is a language and environment for statistical computing and graphics. (R Core Team 2018) \\(R\\) provides a wide variety of statistical (linear and nonlinear modelling, classical statistical tests, time-series analysis, classification, clustering, …) and graphical techniques, and is highly extensible. The \\(S\\) language is often the vehicle of choice for research in statistical methodology, and \\(R\\) provides an Open Source route to participation in that activity. One of \\(R\\)’s strengths is the ease with which well-designed publication-quality plots can be produced, including mathematical symbols and formulae where needed. Great care has been taken over the defaults for the minor design choices in graphics, but the user retains full control. What is R Markdown ? According to R Studio: “R Markdown is a format that enables easy authoring of reproducible web reports from R. It combines the core syntax of Markdown (an easy-to-write plain text format for web content) with embedded \\(R\\) code chunks that are run so their output can be included in the final document”. What is Dynamic Reporting? From Penn State Statistics: The traditional way to write a report: Run your analysis in software, like SPSS or R and manually save our output i.e. saving the ANOVA table or using pdf() to save the graphs Type your your description and interpretation in a text editor like Word either drag/drop tables and figures, or worse copy-paste and retype all the numbers A report written in this way can be problematic. For instance, imagine your Mentor/collaborator/journal reviewer telling you that they want to use a sub-sample instead of the entire sample. Or to include a nother variable. You would have to redo all of your work!! Therefore, in this way dynamic also means reproducible, in the sense that people who get the file from you can reproduce the entire work in the report. Is this a popular method for creating reports? YES! Check out Rpubs. This website shares lots of documents written in the way we will introduce below. "],

They increase the power of R by improving existing base R functionalities, or by adding new ones. More information may be found here: https://www.datacamp.com/community/tutorials/r-packages-guide 3.2 Installing packages (via the user interface) You only need to INSTALL packages ONCE per computer. In R Stuido: Click on the Packages tab the panel with the most tabs Click on the word Instsall just under and to the left of the tab In the Packages box, type in the name of the packages you would like to download. You can do several at once, just seperate them with multiple spaces or a comma. Note: Leave the installation library path as the default. Also, make sure the box for ‘Installing dependencies’ is checked. You can copy-and-paste the following list into the box (labeled 3) to load the packages that we use most commonly all at once. tidyverse, furniture, pander, stargazer, texreg, xtable, kableExtra, RColorBrewer, gghighlight, ggthemes, ggfortify, ggalt, ggExtra, GGally, ggeffects, corrplot, gpairs, gridextra, likert, vcd, scales, cowplot, yarrr, psych, polycor, corpcor, sjlabelled, sjPlot, sjmisc, sjstats, Hmisc, labelled, afex, emmeans, corpcor, multicomp, multcompView, car, effects, predictmean, nlme, lme4, lmerTest, HLMdiag, geepack, gee, gee4, optimx, MuMIn, lavaan, OpenMx, sem, semPlot, randomForest, randomForestSRC, ggRandomForests, party, partykit, mgcv, glmnet, survival, caret, bookdown, blogdown, tidytex, xaringan, REDCapR, redcapAPI, devtools, testthat, roxygen2 When you click the Install buttom, a smaller window may asks if you would like to re-start \\(R\\) prior to installing, choose “no” and manually close and open the \\(R Studio\\) program once all packages have been downloaded, unpacked, and checked. This may take a few minutes, especially if you have selected multiple packages. 3.3 Useful Packages A curated list of awesome \\(R\\) packages and tools: https://awesome-r.com/ 3.3.1 The Tidy-Universe from \\(R Studio\\) install.packages(&quot;tidyverse&quot;) The tidyverse (www.tidyverse.org) is an opinionated collection of \\(R\\) packages designed for data science. All packages share an underlying design philosophy, grammar, and data structures. 3.3.1.1 Core The core tidyverse includes the packages that you are likely to use in everyday data analyses.

With unilur you can render the following outputs from a single rmarkdown file: the exam or tutorial questions (answers remaining hidden) as a PDF or HTML file. the exam or tutorial questions with sample answers as a PDF or HTML file. In addition, you will be able to: Create coloured boxes to highlight some markdown or R content.

The package uses the \\(LaTeX\\) document class apa6 and a .docx-reference file, so you can create PDF documents, or Word documents if you have to. Moreover, papaja supplies \\(R\\) functions that facilitate reporting results of your analyses in accordance with APA guidelines. papaja has not yet been submitted to \\(CRAN\\) because it is under active development. Currently, there are still a couple of loose ends they would like to tie up before we release the package to a larger audience. There are two versions you can install from the \\(GitHub\\) website.
