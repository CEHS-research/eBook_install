They increase the power of \\(R\\) by improving existing base \\(R\\) functionalities, or by adding new ones. When you download \\(R\\) you are only getting the bare-bones, most basic files. This is nice, as it keeps the program from hogging your entire hard drive, but doesn’t offer much in terms of data anaysis. Today there are over 10,000 packages available on \\(CRAN\\) alone, so downloading all of them would be silly and probably fill your computer several times over. Individual users are left with the freedom to choose which packages they need. More information may be found here: https://www.datacamp.com/community/tutorials/r-packages-guide 3.1.2 Where can you get packages ? A repository is a place where packages are located so you can install them from it. Typically they are online and accesible to everyone. Three of the most popular repositories for \\(R\\) packages are: Repository \\(CRAN\\): the official repository, it is a network of \\(ftp\\) and web servers mantained by the \\(R\\) community around the world. It is coordinated by the \\(R\\) foundation, and for a package to be published here it needs to pass several tests here. \\(GitHub\\): although this is not \\(R\\) specific, \\(GitHub\\) is probably the most popular repository for open source projects. Its popularity comes from the unlimited space for open source, the integration with \\(git\\), a version control software, and its ease to share and collaborate with others. But be aware that there is no review process associated to it. (All the files for this eBook are stored on \\(GitHub\\).) Bioconductor: this is a topic specific repository, intended for open source software for bioinformatics. As \\(CRAN\\), it has its own submission and review processes, and its community is very active having several conferences and meetings per year. 3.2 Installing packages Installing is the act of getting the package files onto your computer and stored in a location on your hard drive where \\(R\\) can find them. Usually the files are zipped/compress and must be extracted/unpacked. The directions below will walk you through the automated process of using the user interface in \\(R Studio\\) (rather than actual syntax). In R Studio: Click on the Packages tab in the panel with the most tabs Click on the word Install just under and to the left of the tab In the box labelled “Packages”, type the name of the package you would like to download. You can do several at once, just seperate them with at least one space or a comma. You only need to INSTALL packages ONCE per computer. Leave the installation “library path” as the default. Also, make sure the box for “Installing dependencies” box is checked. ? You can copy-and-paste the following list into the box (labeled 3 above) to load the packages that we find most commonly used. You can install more packages at any time.

This may take a few minutes, especially if you have selected multiple packages. 3.3 Useful Packages on CRAN A curated list of handy \\(R\\) packages and tools can be found at awesome-r.com 3.3.1 The Tidy-Universe, a META package from \\(R Studio\\) The tidyverse is an opinionated collection of \\(R\\) packages designed for data science. All packages share an underlying design philosophy, grammar, and data structures. The core tidyverse includes the packages that you are likely to use in everyday data analyses. As of tidyverse 1.2.0, the top 8 packages in the following table are included in the core tidyverse. The tidyverse also includes many other packages with more specialised usage. They are not loaded automatically with library(tidyverse), so you’ll need to load each one with its own call to library(). website description dplyr A Grammar of Data Manipulation forcats Tools for Working with Categorical Variables (Factors) ggplot2 Create Elegant Data Visualisations Using the Grammar of Graphics purrr Functional Programming Tools readr Read Rectangular Text Data stringr Simple, Consistent Wrappers for Common String Operations (Text) tibble Simple Data Frames tidyr Easily Tidy Data with broom Convert Statistical Analysis Objects into Tidy Tibbles haven Import and Export SPSS, Stata and SAS Files hms Pretty Time of Day lubridate Make Dealing with Dates a Little Easier magrittr A Forward-Pipe Operator for \\(R\\) glue Interpreted String Literals readxl Read Excel Files tibble Simple Data Frames 3.3.2 Groups of Individual Packages on \\(CRAN\\) 3.3.2.1 Creating Tables website description furniture Tables for Quantitative Scientists pander An R ‘Pandoc’ Writer (makes tables look nice) stargazer Well-Formatted Regression and Summary Statistics Tables texreg Conversion of R Regression Output to LaTeX or HTML Tables xtable Export Tables to LaTeX or HTML kableExtra Construct Complex Table with kable and Pipe Syntax 3.3.2.2 Visualization website description RColorBrewer Color Palettes gghighlight Highlight Lines and Points in ggplot2 ggthemes Extra Themes, Scales, and Geoms for ggplot2 ggExtra Add Marginal Histograms to ggplot2, and More ggplot2 Enhancements ggfortify Data Visualization Tools for Statistical Analysis Results ggalt Lots of extras for ggplot2 GGally Extension to ggplot2 corrplot Visualization of a Correlation Matrix gpairs The Generalized Pairs Plot gridextra Miscellaneous Functions for “Grid” Graphics likert Analysis and Visualization Likert Items vcd Visualizing Categorical Data scales Scale Functions for Visualization cowplot Streamlined Plot Theme &amp;

With unilur you can render the following outputs from a single rmarkdown file: the exam or tutorial questions (answers remaining hidden) as a PDF or HTML file. the exam or tutorial questions with sample answers as a PDF or HTML file. In addition, you will be able to: Create coloured boxes to highlight some markdown or R content. Create examination papers with multiple choice questions a candidate identification form dotted lines placeholders to fill in answers Create a new \\(R Markdown\\) file with solution chunks replaced by empty ones.

The package uses the \\(LaTeX\\) document class apa6 and a .docx-reference file, so you can create PDF documents, or Word documents if you have to. Moreover, papaja supplies \\(R\\) functions that facilitate reporting results of your analyses in accordance with APA guidelines. papaja has not yet been submitted to \\(CRAN\\) because it is under active development. Currently, there are still a couple of loose ends they would like to tie up before we release the package to a larger audience. There are two versions you can install from the \\(GitHub\\) website.
