We prefer to think of it of an environment within which statistical techniques are implemented. \\(R\\) can be extended (easily) via packages. There are about eight packages supplied with the \\(R\\) distribution and many more (over 10,000) are available through the \\(CRAN\\) family of Internet sites covering a very wide range of modern statistics.” - www.r-project.org “Where as \\(R\\) is a programming language that runs computations, \\(R Studio\\) is an integrated development environment (IDE) that provides an interface by adding many convenient features and tools. So the way of having access to a speedometer, rearview mirrors, and a navigation system makes driving much easier, using \\(RStudio’s\\) interface makes using \\(R\\) much easier as well.” - Chester Ismay and Albert Y. Kim For a more in-depth discussion on the difference between \\(R\\) and \\(R Studio\\) IDE, watch this DataCamp video (2m52s). 1.2 R Markdown vs. R Notebook R Markdown R Notebook Plain text that includes shorthand notation to denote formatting, instead of relying on a text editor program display (MS Word). Files are saved with the .Rmd extension. A specific kind of .Rmd file in which the code chunks may be interactively executed/run onscreen and the results/output are shown directly below each code chunk. \\(R Markdown\\) documents are fully reproducible. You may use the productive notebook interface to weave together narrative text and code to produce elegantly formatted output. -(Allaire et al. 2023). More details at the R Studio website: R Markdown, lesson 1 and R Notebooks 1.3 knit-R With the click of a button, the knitr package converts a \\(R notebook\\) (.Rmd) to an intermediary Markdown file (.md), which \\(R Studio\\) will further transform to various final file types, including (Xie 2015): .pdf using \\(LaTeX\\) (beautiful) .html using another package called \\(markdown\\) (highly viewable) Word document using Pandoc (probably be ugly) knitr is an engine for dynamic report generation with \\(R\\). It is a package in the statistical programming language \\(R\\) that enables integration of R code into \\(LaTeX\\), \\(LyX\\), \\(HTML\\), \\(Markdown\\), \\(AsciiDoc\\), and \\(text\\)s documents (Xie 2023). The professionals ar \\(R Studio\\) show it better at their website. 1.4 More Indepth FAQs Helpful Websites: Quick R: Basic Statistics and Introduction to R What is R ? \\(R\\) is a language and environment for statistical computing and graphics. (R Core Team 2022) \\(R\\) provides a wide variety of statistical (linear and nonlinear modelling, classical statistical tests, time-series analysis, classification, clustering, …) and graphical techniques, and is highly extensible. The \\(S\\) language is often the vehicle of choice for research in statistical methodology, and \\(R\\) provides an Open Source route to participation in that activity. One of \\(R\\)’s strengths is the ease with which well-designed publication-quality plots can be produced, including mathematical symbols and formulae where needed. Great care has been taken over the defaults for the minor design choices in graphics, but the user retains full control. What is R Markdown ? According to R Studio: “\\(R Markdown\\) is a format that enables easy authoring of reproducible web reports from \\(R\\). It combines the core syntax of Markdown (an easy-to-write plain text format for web content) with embedded \\(R\\) code chunks that are run so their output can be included in the final document”. What is Dynamic Reporting? From Penn State Statistics: The traditional way to write a report: Run your analysis in software, like SPSS, and manually save our output i.e. saving huge output files with hundreds of pages Type your your description and interpretation in a text editor, like Word, either drag/drop tables or worse retyping all the numbers A report written in this way can be problematic. For instance, imagine your Mentor/collaborator/journal reviewer telling you that they want to use a sub-sample instead of the entire sample, or exclude three subjects for a specifica reason. Or more likely to include another variable. You would have to redo all of your work!! If you are using a \\(R Notebook\\), you just change/add a few lines of code and re-run the entire file. Everything gets updated internally. Hours saved! Another bonus is that the single \\(R Notebook\\) file includes exact details of every step: which data file you used, how your cleaned/wrangled your data, and exactly how models were specified. Therefore, in this way dynamic also means reproducible, in the sense that people who get the file from you can reproduce the entire work in the report. No guessing which version of your file you used and hunting through stacks of output. Is this a popular method for creating reports? YES! Check out Rpubs. This website shares lots of documents written in the way we will introduce below.

Read some of the past names and find out where they came from: blog post 2.2 The R Studio IDE Posit (formorly named ‘RStudio’) is a company that is also an active member of the \\(R\\) community. They believe free and open source data analysis software is a foundation for innovative and important work in science, education, and industry. Their namesake software, \\(RStudio\\), is an integrated development environment (IDE) for \\(R\\). It includes a console, syntax-highlighting editor that supports direct code execution, as well as tools for plotting, history, debugging and workspace management. They haven also recently developed an alternate called \\(Quatro\\) which I’m keeping a close eye on.

It’s chartered to fund and inspire ideas that will enable \\(R\\) to become an even better platform for science, research, and industry. 2.3 TeX \\(\\TeX\\) or \\(\\LaTeX\\) is a typesetting or formatting system that is commonly used in printing and publishing, especially anything with formulas (see https://texfaq.org/FAQ-whatTeX). It is NOT NEEDED to run \\(R\\), but \\(R Studio\\) must have access to it in order to knit a \\(R Notebook\\) into a .pdf file. There are many versions, but the following are the ones that work best with \\(R\\), depending on your computer’s platform. The R package calledtinyteX is still a relatively new project which strives to offer all the functionality of \\(\\LaTeX\\), but remain lightweight and easier to maintain compared to full installations of MacTeX or MikTeX. I am now using this in place of LaTeX! Find out more about tinytex at https://yihui.org/tinytex/ To download and install tinytex you will need to copy-paste the following code into your console (or a code chunk) and run it. This only needs to be done once per computer. install.packages(&#39;tinytex&#39;) tinytex::install_tinytex() "],["install-packages.html", "3 Install Packages 3.1 Package FAQ 3.2 Installing packages 3.3 Useful Packages on CRAN 3.4 Userful Packages on \\(GitHub\\)", " 3 Install Packages Learn what packages are and how to get them. 3.1 Package FAQ 3.1.1 What are packages ? \\(R\\) packages are collections of functions and data sets (just files) developed by the community (or you). They increase the power of \\(R\\) by improving existing base \\(R\\) functionalities, or by adding new ones. When you download \\(R\\) you are only getting the bare-bones, most basic files. This is nice, as it keeps the program from hogging your entire hard drive, but doesn’t offer much in terms of data anaysis. Today there are over 10,000 packages available on \\(CRAN\\) alone, so downloading all of them would be silly and probably fill your computer several times over. Individual users are left with the freedom to choose which packages they need. More information may be found here: https://www.datacamp.com/community/tutorials/r-packages-guide 3.1.2 Where can you get packages ? A repository is a place where packages are located so you can install them from it. Typically they are online and accesible to everyone. Three of the most popular repositories for \\(R\\) packages are: Repository \\(CRAN\\): the official repository, it is a network of \\(ftp\\) and web servers mantained by the \\(R\\) community around the world. It is coordinated by the \\(R\\) foundation, and for a package to be published here it needs to pass several tests here. \\(GitHub\\): although this is not \\(R\\) specific, \\(GitHub\\) is probably the most popular repository for open source projects. Its popularity comes from the unlimited space for open source, the integration with \\(git\\), a version control software, and its ease to share and collaborate with others. But be aware that there is no review process associated to it. (All the files for this eBook are stored on \\(GitHub\\).) Bioconductor: this is a topic specific repository, intended for open source software for bioinformatics. As \\(CRAN\\), it has its own submission and review processes, and its community is very active having several conferences and meetings per year. 3.2 Installing packages Installing is the act of getting the package files onto your computer and stored in a location on your hard drive where \\(R\\) can find them. Usually the files are zipped/compress and must be extracted/unpacked. The directions below will walk you through the automated process of using the user interface in \\(R Studio\\) (rather than actual syntax). In R Studio: Click on the Packages tab in the panel with the most tabs Click on the word Install just under and to the left of the tab In the box labelled “Packages”, type the name of the package you would like to download. You can do several at once, just seperate them with at least one space or a comma. You only need to INSTALL packages ONCE per computer. Leave the installation “library path” as the default. Also, make sure the box for “Installing dependencies” box is checked. ? You can copy-and-paste the following list into the box (labeled 3 above) to load the packages that we find most commonly used. You can install more packages at any time.

This may take a few minutes, especially if you have selected multiple packages. 3.3 Useful Packages on CRAN A curated list of handy \\(R\\) packages and tools can be found at awesome-r.com 3.3.1 The Tidy-Universe, a META package from \\(R Studio\\) The tidyverse is an opinionated collection of \\(R\\) packages designed for data science. All packages share an underlying design philosophy, grammar, and data structures. The core tidyverse includes the packages that you are likely to use in everyday data analyses. As of tidyverse 1.2.0, the top 8 packages in the following table are included in the core tidyverse. The tidyverse also includes many other packages with more specialised usage. They are not loaded automatically with library(tidyverse), so you’ll need to load each one with its own call to library(). website description dplyr A Grammar of Data Manipulation forcats Tools for Working with Categorical Variables (Factors) ggplot2 Create Elegant Data Visualisations Using the Grammar of Graphics purrr Functional Programming Tools readr Read Rectangular Text Data stringr Simple, Consistent Wrappers for Common String Operations (Text) tibble Simple Data Frames tidyr Easily Tidy Data with broom Convert Statistical Analysis Objects into Tidy Tibbles haven Import and Export SPSS, Stata and SAS Files hms Pretty Time of Day lubridate Make Dealing with Dates a Little Easier magrittr A Forward-Pipe Operator for \\(R\\) glue Interpreted String Literals readxl Read Excel Files tibble Simple Data Frames 3.3.2 Groups of Individual Packages on \\(CRAN\\) 3.3.2.1 TinyTex TinyTeX is a custom LaTeX distribution based on TeX Live that is small in size, but functions well in most cases, especially for R users.
