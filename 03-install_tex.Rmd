Here is where we talk about installing Tex.

-----------

## Use `tinytex` package


-----------

## Mac - use `MacTeX`

> Go to: [http://tug.org/mactex/](http://tug.org/mactex/) 

* Download (5+ min) to a folder and them double click on the **PKG file**
* Follow the installation instructions.
* You don't need to open anything after MacTeX is finished installing. 

-----------

## Windows - use `MikTeX`

> Go to: [http://miktex.org/download](http://miktex.org/download)

* Pick the latest version of the **Net Installer**, not the Basic! 
* You need the full version 64-bit is better, if you have a 64-bit machine
* When your download is complete, run the downloaded installer. 
* Windows may ask you if you want to *“allow this app from an unknown publisher to make changes to your PC”*. If it does, make sure to click **Yes!**
* This is the slowest part...
