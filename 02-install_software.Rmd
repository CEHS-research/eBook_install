## TeX (optional)

TeX is a typesetting or formatting system that is commonly used in printing and publishing, especially anything with formulas (see https://texfaq.org/FAQ-whatTeX).  It is NOT NEEDED to run $R$, but $R Stuido$ must have access to it in order to `knit` a $R Notebook$ into a `.pdf` file.



### Mac - use `MacTeX`


 ```{block type='rmdlink', echo=TRUE}
Go to: [http://tug.org/mactex/](http://tug.org/mactex/) 
```


* Download (5+ min) to a folder and them double click on the **PKG file**
* Follow the installation instructions.
* You don't need to open anything after MacTeX is finished installing. 



### Windows - use `MikTeX`

 ```{block type='rmdlink', echo=TRUE}
Go to: [http://miktex.org/download](http://miktex.org/download)
```


* Pick the latest version of the **Net Installer**, not the Basic! 
* You need the full version 64-bit is better, if you have a 64-bit machine
* When your download is complete, run the downloaded installer. 
* Windows may ask you if you want to *“allow this app from an unknown publisher to make changes to your PC”*. If it does, make sure to click **Yes!**
* This is the slowest part...


### Use `tinytex` package
 

```{block type='rmdconstruct', echo=TRUE}
**ADD SECTION:** new package alternative to using full TeX
