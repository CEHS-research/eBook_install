You will need to install both $R$ and $R Studio$, but $\LaTeX$ is optional.


## The R Programing Language {#installR}

> The **“Comprehensive R Archive Network” (CRAN)** is a collection of sites which carry identical material, consisting of the $R$  distribution(s), the contributed extensions (packages), and documentation for $R$.  From $CRAN$, you can obtain the latest official FREE release of BASE $R$.

```{block type='rmddownload', echo=TRUE} 
Go to: [www.r-project.org](http://www.r-project.org)   

* Choose a CRAN mirror close to your geographical location    
* Select **base** $R$ for your computer *(Windows, Mac, ect.)*    
* Once it is downloaded, run the installation.    
* The defaults are good...don't change them...just keep clicking *'Next'*    
```

```{block type='rmdlink', echo=TRUE}
The $R$ Project website has an extensive [FAQ](https://cran.r-project.org/doc/FAQ/R-FAQ.html)
```


```{block type='rmdlightbulb', echo=TRUE}
Each new release of $R$ is given a name that references a Peanuts strip or film.  Read some of the past names and find out where they came from: [blog post](https://livefreeordichotomize.com/2017/09/28/r-release-names/)

## The R Studio IDE

> **Posit** (formorly named 'RStudio') is a company that is also an active member of the $R$ community. They believe free and open source data analysis software is a foundation for innovative and important work in science, education, and industry. Their namesake software, $RStudio$, is an integrated development environment (IDE) for $R$. It includes a console, syntax-highlighting editor that supports direct code execution, as well as tools for plotting, history, debugging and workspace management. They haven also recently developed an alternate called $Quatro$ which I'm keeping a close eye on.

```{block type='rmddownload', echo=TRUE}
Go to: [www.posit.co](http://www.posit.co) 

* Click the blue "DOWNLOAD RSTUDIO" buttom in the upper-right hand corner
* Select the FREE Open Source **Desktop** Edition of $R Studio$

```{block type='rmdlink', echo=TRUE}
$Posit$ has an entire [online learning library](https://posit.co/resources/).  It is full of helpful links and resources for R programing, R markdown, and statistics.
```

```{block type='rmdlightbulb', echo=TRUE}
**Note:** The [$R Consortium$](https://www.r-consortium.org/) is a collaboration between the $R$ Foundation, $RStudio$, $Microsoft$, $TIBCO$, $Google$, $Oracle$, $HP$ and others. It’s chartered to fund and inspire ideas that will enable $R$ to become an even better platform for science, research, and industry.

## TeX 


> $\TeX$ or $\LaTeX$ is a typesetting or formatting system that is commonly used in printing and publishing, especially anything with formulas (see https://texfaq.org/FAQ-whatTeX).  It is NOT NEEDED to run $R$, but $R Studio$ must have access to it in order to `knit` a $R Notebook$ into a `.pdf` file.  There are many versions, but the following are the ones that work best with $R$, depending on your computer's platform.



### New Option: the `tinytex` package
 
 
`tinyteX` is still a relatively new project which strives to offer all the functionality of $\LaTeX$, but remain lightweight and easier to maintain.  

```{block type='rmdlink', echo=TRUE}
I am now using this in place of LaTeX!
```



### Mac - use `MacTeX` (no longer needed!)


```{block type='rmddownload', echo=TRUE}
Go to:  [http://tug.org/mactex/](http://tug.org/mactex/)     

* Download (5+ min) to a folder and them double click on the **PKG file**
* Follow the installation instructions.
* You don't need to open anything after MacTeX is finished installing. 
```

### Windows - use `MikTeX` (no longer needed!)

```{block type='rmddownload', echo=TRUE}
Go to: [http://miktex.org/download](http://miktex.org/download)     

* Pick the latest version of the **Net Installer**, not the Basic!     
* You need the full version 64-bit is better, if you have a 64-bit machine    
* When your download is complete, run the downloaded installer.     
* Windows may ask you if you want to *“allow this app from an unknown publisher to make changes to your PC”*. If it does, make sure to click **Yes!**    
* This is the slowest part...
