# Introduction {-}

-------------

**What is R?**

R is a language and environment for statistical computing and graphics. [@R-base]

R provides a wide variety of statistical (linear and nonlinear modelling, classical statistical tests, time-series analysis, classification, clustering, ...) and graphical techniques, and is highly extensible. The S language is often the vehicle of choice for research in statistical methodology, and R provides an Open Source route to participation in that activity.

One of Râ€™s strengths is the ease with which well-designed publication-quality plots can be produced, including mathematical symbols and formulae where needed. Great care has been taken over the defaults for the minor design choices in graphics, but the user retains full control.

**What is R Markdown?**

According to [R Studio](www.rstudio.com):

> "R Markdown is a format that enables easy authoring of reproducible web reports from R. It combines the core syntax of Markdown (an easy-to-write **plain text** format for web content) with embedded **R code chunks** that are run so their output can be included in the final document".



-------------------------------

**Dynamic Reporting**

From [Penn State Statistics](https://onlinecourses.science.psu.edu/statprogram/markdown): 

**The traditional way to write a report**

1. Run your analysis in software, like SPSS or R and manually save our output
    * *i.e. saving the ANOVA table or using pdf() to save the graphs*  

2. Type your your description and interpretation in a text editor like *Word*
    * *either drag/drop tables and figures, or worse copy-paste and retype all the numbers*

A report written in this way can be problematic.  For instance, imagine your *Mentor/collaborator/journal reviewer*  telling you that they want to use a sub-sample instead of the entire sample. Or to include a nother variable.  You would have to redo all of your work!! 

Therefore, in this way **dynamic also means reproducible**, in the sense that people who get the file from you can reproduce the entire work in the report.




**How does R Markdown work out to be a .pdf or .html file?**

`R Markdown` is a file with the file extension **.Rmd**, the `knitr` package will then transform the file into a **Markdown** file with the extension **.md.** Then Rstudio can [@xie2015]:

  * Use `LaTeX` to transform the file into a **.pdf** 
    
  * Load another package called `markdown` to transform the file into **.html**   
    
  * Use Pandoc to even convert to file to a **Word** document (ugly)



**Is this a **popular** method for creating reports?**

Check out [Rpubs](http://rpubs.com/). This website shares lots of documents written in the way we will introduce below.

> `R Markdown` documents are fully reproducible. Use a productive **notebook** interface to weave together narrative text and code to produce elegantly formatted output. Use multiple languages including R, Python, and SQL [@R-rmarkdown].

> `knitr` is an engine for dynamic report generation with R. It is a package in the statistical programming language R that enables integration of **R code** into LaTeX, LyX, HTML, Markdown, AsciiDoc, and **text** documents [@R-knitr].
