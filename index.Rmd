## Preface {-}

This encyclopedia of eBooks is being developed by the [Office of Research Services](https://cehs.usu.edu/research/index) to serves the faculty and graduate students in the [College of Education and Human Services](https://cehs.usu.edu/) at [Utah State University](http://www.usu.edu/).  



The three main purposes are to: 

* Provide reference material for graduate quantitative methods courses *(EDUC/PSY 6600, EDUC/PSY 7610, PSY 7650, ect.)*  
* Support college wide workshops given by the [Statistical Consulting Studio](https://cehs.usu.edu/research/statstudio/index) and [Data Science and Discover Unit](https://cehs.usu.edu/research/dsdu/index)
* Facilitate individual consultations with the authors pertaining to research.

## Why R ?  {-}



```{block type='rmdconstruct', echo=TRUE}
**ADD SECTION:** R vs. SPSS, SAS, Stata, ect...

FREE, accessable, 
not any harder than others to learn
reproducibity
```


```{block type='rmdlink', echo=TRUE}
**Check it out:** an article from Fall 2016... [No more excuses: R is better than SPSS for psychology undergrads, and students agree](https://datahowler.wordpress.com/2016/09/10/no-more-excuses-r-is-better-than-spss-for-psychology-undergrads-and-students-agree/)
```




## FYI  {-}

The entire encyclopedia is written in $R Markdown$, using $R Studio$ as the text editor and the `bookdown` package to turn a collection of markdown documents into a coherent whole. The book's source code is hosted on GitHub, at https://github.com/cehs-research/eBook_install. If you notice typos or other issues, feel free to open an issue on GitHub or send me a pull request. If you do the latter, in your commit message, please add the sentence "I assign the copyright of this contribution to Dr.s Schwartz and Barrett," so that I can maintain the option of publishing this book in other forms.
